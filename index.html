                <h2>Skyrim</h2>
                <p>Member of a 5-person project team for the development of a web-based application that shows an interactive map of Skyrim.
                    The project involved selecting and calculating the shortest route between two cities using the Dijkstra algorithm.
                    Technologies used include React, JavaScript and CSS for the frontend, TypeScript and 
                    MongoDB for the backend, as well as Keycloak for authentication and REST
                    APIs for communication. Gained knowledge includes teamwork in the framework of a larger development project, the use of GitLab for version control, creating issues for task management, implementing pipelines and CI/CD processes for continuous integration and deployment. These experiences have my ability to 
                    effective planning, team collaboration and implementation of complex functions greatly improved.</p>

                <h2>Shopping list</h2>
                <p>Developed a full-stack web application for the management of 
                    shopping lists using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and React. 
                    The application enables the creation, editing and prioritization of shopping lists and the management of articles. An integration of the Spoonacular API has been implemented to search recipes and automatically generate shopping lists based on ingredients. In addition the application supports dynamic prioritization, sorting and advanced 
                    search functions.
                    To ensure API functionality, automated tests were implemented using Jest and Supertest.</p>

                <h2>Password strength checker</h2>
                <p>I have developed an innovative web application that allows
                    users to test the strength of their passwords and learn how
                    long it would take to crack them. The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS
                    and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and interactive interface. The backend, also implemented in JavaScript, uses
                    Hashcat to analyze and crack hashed passwords. Via a
                    real-time socket connection, the progress and results of the
                    cracking process are transmitted live to the frontend, giving users
                    immediate feedback.</p>

                <h2>Jewlery Store</h2>
                <p>Designed and developed a responsive and visually appealing landing page for "Mangata & Gallo," a fictional Austin-based jewelry store specializing in engagement, wedding, and anniversary pieces. The project utilized HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling, with a focus on modern web design principles and a minimalistic aesthetic. High-quality images and branding assets were seamlessly integrated, complemented by custom fonts (Playfair Display and Lora) and a cohesive color scheme. The layout features a clean navigation menu and sections to showcase featured products, ensuring an elegant user experience across devices through a mobile-first design approach.</p>
